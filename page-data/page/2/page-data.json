The SDV was\nborn out of academic research at MIT — but in 2018, we open-sourced it, so that\npeople all over the world could use it.\n\nSince then, we've been listening carefully to our community's feedback, making\nsure that we address any gaps between theoretical academic research and\npractical use. This multi-part series details recent improvements we've made so\nthat SDV works in the real world. In this article, we focus on the machine\nlearning-based modeling techniques that form the core of the system, while Part\n2 [https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/] will cover the surrounding\nworkflow.\n\nWhat's in a model?\nAt its core, the SDV is a set of machine learning models designed to understand\nand mimic real world data. Once the SDV creates a particular model, developers\ncan generate synthetic data by sampling it. For synthetic data to be successful,\nthis generative model must be correct — but through discussions with our open\nsource community, we realized that there is no such thing as a single, winning\napproach that works every time. Each dataset and use case is different.\n\n\nOur solution is to provide choices, giving users all the necessary tools to make\nuseful synthetic data for each new case at hand. Let's dive into three popular\nuses of the SDV where such options are available: Tabular models, sequential\ndata and business logic.\n\nMore Options for Tabular Models\nThe earliest version of SDV was based on a classic statistical method: Gaussian\nCopulas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)]. This model\nis transparent by definition. It allows us to understand and exert control over\nformulas in the model, notably the distributions of each variable. This can be\nespecially useful for business applications, where data often follows\npredictable distributions. For example, wind speed is known to follow a Weibull\ndistribution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power], biological measures\nlike height usually follow normal distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Occurrence_and_applications] \nand credit default rates often follow exponential distributions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution].\n\nMeanwhile, advances in the AI space had also produced a robust, alternative\nmodel for those willing to sacrifice transparency: A deep learning technique\ncalled Generative Adversarial Networks\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network] (GANs). GANs\nmodel complex processes that don't follow known formulas. While these models’\ninner workings aren’t easily explained by humans, they produce highly accurate\nresults. We created a GAN, called CTGAN, specifically for synthetic data. This\nblack box model is especially good at figuring out complex correlations between\nvariables in large datasets.\n\nFor a long time, SDV allowed users a choice between our Gaussian Copulas based\nmodel, called GaussianCopula, and CTGAN to model tabular data. While this choice\nprovided some flexibility, our users reported they had a hard time choosing\nbetween such extreme alternatives. We wondered if a middle ground was possible:\nCould we specify distributions while also using GANs to identify complex\ncorrelations?\n\nWe couldn't find any model that fit both of these requirements, so we made our\nown! A key insight was that we could use Gaussian Copulas to understand the data\nand transform it before applying it to a GAN. The result is CopulaGAN\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/copulagan.html], a hybrid model we\nreleased in October 2020.\n\nCopulaGAN is in the middle of the spectrum, between simple, easily understood\nmodels (like GaussianCopula) and complex black box models (like CTGAN).CopulaGAN\ncombines the human accessibility of Gaussian Copulas with the robust accuracy of\nGANs. This innovation provides users with a new choice: a hybrid approach.\n\nThe Special Case of Sequential Data\nAnother tricky case pointed out by our users involved sequential data. While\nsequential data is stored in a table, it is unlike a regular table in that its\nrows are linked together, usually by a time component. This use case is\nextremely frequent, especially in finance — any table with credit card\ntransactions, stock prices, or payments is almost certainly sequential. \n\nAt the time, solutions treated sequential data as a case of general tabular\nmodeling. After all, sequential data is inside a table. However, these solutions\nfailed to incorporate the key information that makes sequential data unique: The\nrelationships that exist between rows.\n\nIn this table of stock prices, rows that describe the same company — in this\ncase, Google — are related to each other through time. Related rows are a\nspecial feature of sequential datasets.While considering this pain point, we\nrecognized sequential data as an entirely new case that required its own unique\nset of modeling techniques. In October 2020, we released our DeepEcho library,\nwhich focuses entirely on sequential data. We also introduced our PAR model:\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/timeseries/par.html] a GAN approach made\nspecifically for sequential data.\n\nEncoding Business Logic using Constraints\nEven with a plethora of modeling choices, it's vital to capture nuances in\nbusiness logic while modeling synthetic data. This is due to differences in how\nhumans and machines understand datasets.\n\nOften, humans can easily glean the meaning of a dataset using context clues.\nConsider a table showing the names and ages of students and their legal\nguardians. A human will intuitively realize that a student must be younger than\ntheir guardian.\n\nIn this table of students and their guardians, the student is always younger\nthan their guardian. This is a constraint that humans intuitively understand.But\nwill a machine understand the same rule? Because all of the SDV's models use\nstatistics, they analyze trends generally — meaning that in this case, they will\ninclude a small possibility that a student could be older than their guardian.\nAfter all, is it totally out of the question that an older individual could\nenroll and list their child as their guardian? Either way, only a human expert\ncan truly figure out what makes sense for this dataset!\n\nTo solve this pain point, SDV introduced the concept of constraints\n[https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/single_table/constraints.html] in July 2020.\nConstraints give users the ability to encode their business knowledge and\nexpertise into an SDV model. In our example, they could specify that a\nguardian's age must be greater than the student's. Currently, the GreaterThan\nand UniqueCombination constraints allow for easy handling of common scenarios.\nWe also provide a blanket CustomConstraint class, which gives users flexibility\nto capture more nuanced knowledge.\n\nMore Community Feedback\nWe believe that the more humans and machines can work together, the more\nefficient our processes can become. In this article, we explained how user\nfeedback about the SDV led to new core modeling techniques and innovations —\nenabling a system that now provides a choice of multiple models, handles\nsequential data, and understands constraints. In Part 2\n[https://sdv.dev/blog/community-feedback-workflow/], we will discuss similar\nfeedback-driven innovations in the rest of the workflow.\n\nUsing SDV — and giving us feedback — fuels this rapid evolution. To start a\ndiscussion, please message us on Slack [https://bit.ly/sdv-slack-invite] or file\nan issue on GitHub [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV]. Working together, we can\nmake SDV the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive platform for synthetic\ndata generation!\n\nFor other inquiries, please contact info@sdv.dev.","html":"<p>In our <a href=\"https://sdv.dev/blog/intro-to-sdv/\">last post</a>, we introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV\">Synthetic Data Vault</a> (SDV) — a software system that allows users to input a dataset and generate synthetic data.

We, the creators of MIT's Synthetic Data Vault, warmly welcome you\nto our official blog. Soon we'll be using this space to deep-dive into topics\nrelated to our libraries, and to unpack ideas in the synthetic data space. We're\nlooking forward to exploring this exciting area with you.\n\nBut first, we want to properly introduce our project: The Synthetic Data Vault\n[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] (SDV), an open source software ecosystem for\ngenerating synthetic data. In this post, we’ll explain why synthetic data is\nimportant, and tell the story of how we created the vault. We’ll also lay out\nwhat’s in store — and how you can get involved. Let’s get started with a brief\noverview.\n\nSynthetic Data What?\nSynthetic data is a bold new frontier in machine learning. It allows developers\nto share and use data more effectively.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but although billions of gigabytes of data are\nproduced every day, there are still huge gaps in what developers are actually\nable to use. Accessibility concerns, regulatory issues and imbalanced datasets\ncan all keep experts from using data. This impedes progress in finance, health\ncare and other domains.\n\nGood synthetic data can fill these gaps. The SDV uses machine learning to\nanalyze data. Then, it creates fully synthetic datasets that mimic the original.\nAlthough the synthetic data is entirely machine generated, it maintains the\noriginal format and mathematical properties. This makes synthetic data\nversatile. It can completely replace the existing data in a workflow, or it can\nsupplement the data to enhance its utility. Already, our users have successfully\nused the SDV to augment datasets, test applications, remove bias and more.\n\nA History of the SDV\nOur story starts in 2013. In MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision\nSystems (LIDS), we were working on general data science projects. We had\ndeveloped new techniques, and we were excited to test them on real datasets.\nHowever, as soon as we asked for the data, we hit roadblocks. The process for\ngetting access to data turned out to be much more complex than we anticipated,\nwith many regulations and security red tape. \n\nWe wondered: What if we didn't need the real data in the first place? If we had\nsynthetic data with the same mathematical properties as the original, it would\nbe much easier for everyone to share and use.\n\nIn 2016, we released a paper describing the very first iteration of the SDV\n[https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SDV.pdf]. It introduced a\nnovel technique for synthesizing multi-table data, and included trials where\ndata scientists successfully used synthetic data instead of real data for\nmachine learning tasks. Related research to come out of the lab included CTGAN\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf], a novel approach to generating synthetic\ndata using deep learning.\n\nAfter these successes in the research community, we decided to move beyond\npurely academic solutions. Synthetic data has the potential to solve real-world\nproblems faced by people on all sides of data science: internal developers\nwriting software, external contractors working offshore, 3rd party partners\noffering services and even the end users who create the data. After some pilot\ntesting on enterprise applications, we open sourced our work in 2018, publishing \nsdv on PyPi [https://pypi.org/project/sdv/] for general use. Open sourcing\noffered ample opportunities for collaboration and customization. It allowed\nusers all over the world to test the SDV in enterprise settings, and helped the\nSDV ecosystem evolve into a one-stop shop for synthetic data needs!\n\nUsers all over the world are using our software to create synthetic data. This\nmap shows the total downloads* of CTGAN [https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN] (our\nmost popular synthetic data model) per continent.We listened to feedback and, as\nof today, have made 93 releases (across all our libraries), addressing 504\nissues. We have been thrilled to see a burgeoning community of invested users\nusing the SDV to solve problems. We've seen over 200K user downloads from PyPi,\n400 stars in the SDV GitHub repository [https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV] and 200\ndevelopers in our Slack channel. Our community is global and includes people in\ndiverse roles: academics, data scientists, operations managers, engineers and\nmore. We are continually learning from our community, and we're excited to bring\nnew innovations to you!\n\nJust the Beginning\nSynthetic data has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of data\nscience, allowing us to solve problems that once seemed untouchable. We want the\nSynthetic Data Vault to be the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive\nplatform for synthetic data generation, but we can't do it without our users.\nIt's our ever-growing open source community that allows us to quickly repair\nbugs, triage feature requests and improve to serve a variety of real-world\nneeds.\n\nThat’s where you come in.

Soon we'll be using this space to deep-dive into topics related to our libraries, and to unpack ideas in the synthetic data space. We're looking forward to exploring this exciting area with you.</p><p>But first, we want to properly introduce our project: The <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV\">Synthetic Data Vault</a> (SDV), an open source software ecosystem for generating synthetic data. In this post, we’ll explain why synthetic data is important, and tell the story of how we created the vault. We’ll also lay out what’s in store — and how you can get involved. Let’s get started with a brief overview.</p><h3 id=\"synthetic-data-what\">Synthetic Data What?</h3><p>Synthetic data is a bold new frontier in machine learning. It allows developers to share and use data more effectively.</p><p>It may seem counterintuitive, but although billions of gigabytes of data are produced every day, there are still huge gaps in what developers are actually able to use. Accessibility concerns, regulatory issues and imbalanced datasets can all keep experts from using data. This impedes progress in finance, health care and other domains.</p><p>Good synthetic data can fill these gaps. The SDV uses machine learning to analyze data. Then, it creates fully synthetic datasets that mimic the original. Although the synthetic data is entirely machine generated, it maintains the original format and mathematical properties. This makes synthetic data versatile. It can completely replace the existing data in a workflow, or it can supplement the data to enhance its utility. Already, our users have successfully used the SDV to augment datasets, test applications, remove bias and more.</p><h3 id=\"a-history-of-the-sdv\">A History of the SDV</h3><p>Our story starts in 2013. In MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), we were working on general data science projects. We had developed new techniques, and we were excited to test them on real datasets. However, as soon as we asked for the data, we hit roadblocks. The process for getting access to data turned out to be much more complex than we anticipated, with many regulations and security red tape. </p><p>We wondered: What if we didn't need the real data in the first place? If we had synthetic data with the same mathematical properties as the original, it would be much easier for everyone to share and use.</p><p>In 2016, we released a paper describing the very first iteration of the <a href=\"https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SDV.pdf\">SDV</a>. It introduced a novel technique for synthesizing multi-table data, and included trials where data scientists successfully used synthetic data instead of real data for machine learning tasks. Related research to come out of the lab included <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf\">CTGAN</a>, a novel approach to generating synthetic data using deep learning.</p><p>After these successes in the research community, we decided to move beyond purely academic solutions. Synthetic data has the potential to solve real-world problems faced by people on all sides of data science: internal developers writing software, external contractors working offshore, 3rd party partners offering services and even the end users who create the data. After some pilot testing on enterprise applications, we open sourced our work in 2018, publishing <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sdv/\">sdv on PyPi</a> for general use. Open sourcing offered ample opportunities for collaboration and customization. It allowed users all over the world to test the SDV in enterprise settings, and helped the SDV ecosystem evolve into a one-stop shop for synthetic data needs!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/2021/04/Blog-Map.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A world map with download statistics from different continents.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1279\" srcset=\"https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 1000w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 1600w, https://sdv.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/04/Blog-Map.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Users all over the world are using our software to create synthetic data.

We have been thrilled to see a burgeoning community of invested users using the SDV to solve problems. We've seen over 200K user downloads from PyPi, 400 stars in the SDV <a href=\"https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV\">GitHub repository</a> and 200 developers in our Slack channel. Our community is global and includes people in diverse roles: academics, data scientists, operations managers, engineers and more. We are continually learning from our community, and we're excited to bring new innovations to you!</p><h3 id=\"just-the-beginning\">Just the Beginning</h3><p>Synthetic data has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of data science, allowing us to solve problems that once seemed untouchable. We want the Synthetic Data Vault to be the most trusted, transparent and comprehensive platform for synthetic data generation, but we can't do it without our users. It's our ever-growing open source community that allows us to quickly repair bugs, triage feature requests and improve to serve a variety of real-world needs.  </p><p>That’s where you come in.
